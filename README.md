in this project i had done so many things like as
scrape the data like title,images,logo,description,location,date&time,price,and so many thing's.
and after scraped the data we had generated event categories from reading descriptions and titles.
and then after i had generated hashtags based on event categories.
for this project i have used some frameworkand third-party libraries  like  express.js mongoose,axios,cheerio,dotenv,cors error for handle the error.
one more things is that- first i have scraped all the links from where i have to do scrape, then put all the link inside one file and import inside main folder,then we can scrape all the data which is store inside the individual link easily.
